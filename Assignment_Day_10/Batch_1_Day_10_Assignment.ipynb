    "1) The avearage house rent in an apartment is 35 per month , X'= 43 and S = 33.(in thousands) Assume level of significance to be .20 and sample is 20. H0:mu=35 So it is two tail test and S is given so t test. Table value is 1.328 and calculated value is .1040 as .1040 lies between -1.328 to +1.328 ,null hypothesis is accepted .\n",
    "\n",
    "2) The avearage rent of a shop in a shopping center is 67 per month, X'= 88 and S = 43.(in thousands) Assume level of significance to be .10 and sample is 25. H0:mu=67 So it is two tail test and S is given so t test Table value is 1.711 and calculated value is 2.4419 as 2.4419 does not lie between -1.711 to +1.711 ,null hypothesis is rejected .\n",
    "\n",
    "3) the mean price of a doll is 15 , given X'=23 and sigma = 11. Assume level of significance to be .10 and sample is 19. H0:mu=15 So it is two tail test and sigma is given so Z test. Table value is 1.734, and calculated value is 1.8353, as 1.8353 does not lie between -1.734 to +1.734 ,null hypothesis is rejected .\n",
    "\n",
    "4) A teacher wanted to know about students IQ so she collected sample of 40 students. IQ score and have a mean score of 112.5. The mean population IQ is 110 with sigma = 10.(alpha is not given assume to be .05) H0:mu=110 So it is two tail test and sigma is given so Z test. Table value is 2.045 and calculated value is 1.5812 as 1.5812 lies between -2.045 to +2.045 ,null hypothesis is accepted.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Average number of children in a home is 3.if X'= 4 and S = 5. Assume level of significance to be .10 and sample is 21. H0:mu >= 3 This is one tail and left tail test. It is a t test as S is given. Table value is 1.328 and calculated value is .9165 as .9165 greater than -1.328 , null hypothesis is accepted.\n",
    "\n",
    "6) Average number of children in a home is 2.if X'= 4 and S = 6. Assume level of significance to be .10 and sample is 17. H0:mu <= 3 This is one tail and right tail test. It is a t test as S is given Table value is 1.337. and calcaluted value is 1.3744, as 1.3744 lies outside the 1.337 , null hypothesis is rejected.\n",
    "\n",
    "7) Average number of children in a home is 4.if X'= 6 and S = 6. Assume level of significance to be .05 and sample is 10. H0:mu <= 3 This is one tail and right tail test. It is a t test as S is given Table value is 1.833. And calcaluted value is 1.0541 , as 1.0541 lies within 1.833 , null hypothesis is accepted.\n",
    "\n",
    "8) Average number of people in a home are 6. X'= 9 and sigma = 10 assume alpha to be .10 and sample is 30 H0:mu <= 6 This is one tail and right tail test. It is a Z test as sigma is given Table value is 1.311 . And calcaluted value is 1.6432 , as 1.6432 lies outside 1.311 , null hypothesis is rejected.\n",
    "\n",
    "9) Average number of people in a home are 5. X'= 8 and sigma = 10 assume alpha to be .05 and sample is 20 H0:mu <= 5 This is one tail and right tail test. It is a Z test as sigma is given Table value is 1.729 . And calcaluted value is 1.3416 , as 1.3416 lies inside 1.729 , null hypothesis is accepted.\n",
    "\n",
    "10) Average number of people in a home are 4. X'= 9 and sigma = 15 assume alpha to be .05 and sample is 25 H0:mu >=4 This is one tail and left tail test. It is a Z test as sigma is given Table value is 1.711. And calcaluted value is 1.6667 , as 1.6667 greater than -1.729 , null hypothesis is accepted."
